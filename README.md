Challenges:
- I originally had wanted to just read the csv file of my daily log like I had done in the hurricane tracker lab. However, i realized that wasn't what I was looking for, so after some digging on the internet I figured out how to use matplotlib and pandas. Now my graph of that information is much more like I was hoping.
- Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to get the information from when the program had run to consistently update the text file I linked. I had originally been trying to write, 'w', in the file when really all I needed to do was append it, 'a'. So that was a pretty quick fix one I went back and watched some videos and looked through runestone.
- Finally, I thought that it was hard to just think of something and then do it. This the only coding I have ever done in my life, and after missing that week of school after spring break it almost seemed like I had to relearn everything on top of the new content. back to the main point, I hadn't ever just had to write a code, it had just been to answer the questions that we got in our labs. So that made it pretty straight forward, but this was a completely abstract idea for me. 

Closing remark:
I am proud of the assignment that I turned in, and I'm glad that I was forced out of my normal business school comfort zone when taking this class and completing the final project. Thanks for reading :)
